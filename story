Once upon a time in jungle, there lived a hare in the forest who always boosted for his running speed. One day he dared the Tortoise to
race in order to show his skills in front of other animals. Race began. The hare immediatly started running and the Tortoise started
at it's usual slow pace. Hare decided to pause and take some rest as he knew that Tortoise will be too far away from him. So he took 
a nap. Meanwhile the tortoise reached the finishing line and won the race. Hare got up and realised his mistake of sleeping.
